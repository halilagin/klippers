I like to add a signer pane on the pdf viewer.

The signer pane should be a component that will be used to sign the pdf file.

The signer pane should be a react component that will be used to sign the pdf file.

Whenever a place is clicked on the pdf viewer, a signer pane should be shown at that place.

The signer pane should have a signature field and a date field.

The signature field should be a signature field.

The date field should be a date field.

The signer pane should be shown at the bottom of the pdf viewer.
After the signer pane is shown, the user should be able to sign the pdf file.
The user will use mouse to draw the signature on the signature field. When mouse is down, the drawing will be continuous, and when the mouse is up, the drawing will be stopped.
