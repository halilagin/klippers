I like to make the signer pane a modal.
The component that shows the signer page is components/SignerPane.jsx

This component is used in src/pages/SignPdfView.jsx

I want to make the signer pane a modal. When it is shown, the pdf viewer should be disabled, and the signer pane should be shown at the center of the screen.
